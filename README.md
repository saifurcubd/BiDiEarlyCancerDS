**Abstract**
Cancer is a complex disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It remains a significant challenge in today's healthcare landscape. Early cancer detection through non-invasive liquid biopsy (NLB) can enable early patient-focused interventions. Considering its clinical significance, we were motivated to address the challenge of enhancing early cancer prevention. We propose an ensemble-optimized machine learning framework (EOLF) for clinical early cancer detection (CECD) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentation profiles, mutational signatures, and circulating biomarkers data from NLB, termed ClinicalEarlyCancerDF.
Different clinical case study data are applied to evaluate the proposed ClinicalEarlyCancerDF method, which demonstrated superior performance compared to other methods and existing studies.  
The first case study of the DELFI cohort revealed the result for binary CECD with an accuracy of 89.83\% (Sensitivity=95.81\% and AUC=0.948) and localized CECD with a median accuracy of 86.84\% (AUC=0.981) based on 10-fold cross-validation (CV). For the second case study of the same DELFI cohort through cfDNA mutation signature data, the proposed framework performed better than the recently published methods with an extended AUC value of 0.971 (Sensitivity=91.75\%) and an accuracy of 90.37\% in 10-fold CV. The case study of the second CancerSEEK cohort also performed better results for binary CECD with an accuracy of 99.34\% (AUC=0.999) and localized CECD with a median 94.85\% accuracy (AUC=0.996). For the robustness and generalizability of our approach, we conducted a 30\% independent data test and external validation using the LUCAS cohort and extracellular protein biomarker datasets. Both of these validations demonstrated consistently strong predictive performance. Lastly, extensive analysis revealed the underlying mechanism behind this method. Additionally, We implemented a platform-independent dynamic web application (BiDiEarlyCancerDS) to render the method's performance and facilitate cancer detection in the first case study of the DELFI cohort. The proposed optimized machine learning framework for CECD is well compared to existing methods across various evaluations and validation tests. This clinical cancer detection system with NLB can enhance the efficiency of early-stage cancer diagnosis and may enable cancer risk assessment for clinical oncologists and practitioners.
